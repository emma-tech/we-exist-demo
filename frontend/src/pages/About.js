            When we had heard these arguments a few times too much, we realized
            that now it must be enough! For some companies we are mostly a myth,
            a phenomenon that they do not even believe exists, while for others
            we are rather seen as a rare phenomenon that you do not know where
            to look for. Regardless, we are here to show: we exist!

            explanations. We want to show that we exist and are here to deliver!
