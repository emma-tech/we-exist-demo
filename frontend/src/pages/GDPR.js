          <h3 tabindex="0">What does processing mean?</h3>
          <Text>
            Processing of personal data includes, for example, receiving,
            reading, modifying, deleting and storing personal data. But also to
            reorganize, structure, process and transfer personal data to a third
            party.
          </Text>

          <h3 tabindex="0">The personal information we collect and why</h3>
          <Text>
            All personal data we collect is done in accordance with the basic
            principles of the Data Protection Ordinance. This means that the
            personal data is processed in a legal, correct and transparent
            manner in relation to the data subject. We must be transparent about
            what information we handle and ensure that the people who are
            registered with us in various ways can assert their rights in an
            effective manner. We therefore do not collect more personal data
            than we need for the specified purpose, we do not store the personal
            data in more places than necessary and thin personal data when they
            no longer fulfill the purpose for which they were collected. Common
            personal information that we collect is name, e-mail address,
            telephone number, address, allergies, special diet, previous
            purchase information and payment information.
          </Text>

          <h3 tabindex="0">How do we get the personal information?</h3>
          <Text>
            The most common way is that we collect the personal information via
            the website or email, ie the information that you provide to us when
            registering members, at events or other purchases. In connection
            with the expansion of the business, personal data can also be
            collected from third parties and then processed on the basis of a
            balance of interests that you can always object to.
          </Text>

          <h3 tabindex="0">Assistants and transfer of personal data to third countries</h3>
          <Text>
            When we hire personal data assistants, we do so only when the
            personal data assistant provides sufficient guarantees to implement
            appropriate technical and organizational measures in such a way that
            the processing meets the requirements of the law and ensures that
            the data subject's rights are protected. Personal data assistant
            agreements are always entered into with personal data assistants. As
            far as possible, we avoid the transfer of personal data to third
            countries, but when it is necessary or deemed appropriate, this is
            done provided that we have taken sufficient security measures.
          </Text>
          <h3 tabindex="0">Technical and organizational security measures</h3>
          <Text>
            We evaluate the possibilities of taking technical measures, such as
            pseudonymisation and data minimization, in order to effectively live
            up to the requirements of the GDPR and protect the data subject's
            rights. We also carry out appropriate technical and organizational
            measures to ensure that only personal data necessary for each
            specific purpose of the processing are processed.
          </Text>
          <h3 tabindex="0">What happens if there is a personal data incident?</h3>
          <Text>
            A personal data incident is a security incident, it can be anything
            from the server being hacked to a work phone being lost. It is an
            event that leads to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or
            alteration or to unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access
            to the personal data that transferred, stored or otherwise
            processed. All incidents are documented in an incident management
            log where we describe the circumstances, the effects of the incident
            and what measures have been taken to reduce the damage and the
            spread of personal data as far as possible. Some incidents require
            the law to be reported to the Data Inspectorate and in some cases
            also the registered person, in those cases we of course follow the
            law.
